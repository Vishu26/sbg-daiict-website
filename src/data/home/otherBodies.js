          <li>
            The Gender Studies group in DA-IICT has been active since 2015. The
            group meets regularly for literary discussions and conducts gender
            sensitization sessions for newly admitted students since then. It
            now consists of committed volunteers interested in social change.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Gender Studies is a space for DA-IICT community to understand
            gender as it is practised in the society today .The intention of the
            group is to forward sensitization in the community and to engage in
            discussions on the aspects of gender in art, literature, media,
            science and technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            The group strives for inclusivity within the campus and the outside
            world. Apart from conducting sessions for the new batch, we conduct
            various activities throughout the year to discuss about the changes
            in the society and DA-IICT's culture in itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            The group also spread awareness by performing a play that raises
            some questions on the sensitive issues mentioned above. The script
            has been written by <b>Prof Shweta Garg</b> and enacted by{" "}
