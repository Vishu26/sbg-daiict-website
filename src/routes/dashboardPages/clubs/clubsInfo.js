Entelechy, the student-run magazine of DA, has over the years and over its editions, morphed into a voice, a power, a passion and an endeavor in the verve of those it envelops, and that is what makes Entelechy more than a magazine. Entelechy is, to us, a concept of volition; it is the autonomy of thought and an enticement to ingenuity.
